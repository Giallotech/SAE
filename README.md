# Der Nektar

This is a website that I created as part of my learning process in the first semester of the Web Design & Development bachelor's program at the [SAE Institute Hamburg](https://www.sae.edu/deu/campuses/hamburg/#gref).

## Overview

### The challenge

The users should be able to view the optimal layout for the website depending on their device's screen size. They should also be able to see a hover effect on the desktop in the navigation bar and some animations in the Hero Section.
